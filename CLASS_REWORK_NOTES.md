## OTHER PENDING TASKS

### Buff/Debuff Duration Review ⚠️
**IMPORTANT:** Review ALL classes and cards for buff/debuff duration wording.
- Buffs like "+30% damage for 2 turns" waste a turn if played without attacking
- Should be "next 2 attacks" or "next 2 actions" instead of "2 turns"
- Apply this to: damage buffs, strength, weakness, vulnerability, any persistent effect
- Affects: Warrior, Rogue, Paladin, Mage, Cleric, Bard, Archer, Barbarian

### Rogue Special Ability Update
Change from: "Assassinate - 40 damage to one enemy + stealth"
Change to: Stealth + next attack bonus (specifics TBD)

---

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES

1. **Card Distribution:** 7 common, 6 uncommon, 5 rare, 4 legendary
2. **Naming Convention:** D&D-inspired, avoid WoW terminology
3. **Unique Mechanics:** Each class should feel distinct to play
4. **Resource Identity:** Resource name and mechanic should match class fantasy
5. **Balance Considerations:**
   - Legendaries should be powerful but not game-breaking
   - Common cards form the backbone of gameplay
   - Rares/Legendaries provide exciting moments
